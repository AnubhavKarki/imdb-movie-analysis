# Project - IMDB Movie Analysis

## Overview

This project is a concise refresher on descriptive and inferential statistics using the IMDB movie dataset. The focus is on understanding basic statistical measures, visualizing data, and estimating parameters with confidence intervals.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**

   * Selected relevant columns.
   * Converted year and runtime to numeric types.
   * Created a `Decade` column.
   * Handled missing values and formatted `Gross` earnings into millions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics using `describe()`.
   * Visualized distributions and trends with histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
   * Identified top directors by average IMDB rating.

3. **Correlation and Covariance Analysis**

   * Examined relationships between runtime, rating, gross, and metascore.

4. **Inferential Statistics**

   * Calculated confidence intervals for average box office earnings across decades.
   * Illustrated use of t-scores for estimating population parameters.

## Insights

* Highly rated movies average around 123 minutes.
* Frank Darabont emerges as the director of highest rated movies.
* The 2020s show significant positive outliers in ratings.
* Runtime positively correlates with IMDB rating but not with Meta Score.

This project is ideal for those revisiting foundational statistical concepts and applying them to a real-world dataset.
